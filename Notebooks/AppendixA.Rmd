# Say you have a normal distribution with mean μ=6 and standard deviation σ=3.

# (LCA.1) What proportion of the area under the normal curve is less than 3? 
# Greater than 12? Between 0 and 12?

# A:  less than 3 = (13.5 + 2.35 + 0.15) = 16% 
#     Greater than 12 = (2.35 + 0.15) = 2.5%
#     Between 0 and 12 = 99.7%

# (LCA.2) What is the 2.5th percentile of the area under the normal curve? 
# The 97.5th percentile? The 100th percentile?

# A: 2.5th percentile = 0
#    97.5th percentile = 6
#    100th percentile = >12
